	cultivar - optional
    cultivar (cultivated variety) of plant from which sequence was obtained, and is applied solely to products of artificial selection; use the variety qualifier for natural, named plant and fungal varieties

	breed - optional
    Name of genetically-modified or artifically-selected for animal (farm animals, domesticated animals etc.), Example: Large White, Berkshire

	ecotype - optional
    A population within a given species displaying genetically based, phenotypic traits that reflect adaptation to a local habitat.

	sex of organism - optional
    Sex of organism sequence., Example: male, female, mixed

#Collection details

	isolation source - optional

	natural host - optional
    The natural host of the organism from which the sequenced material was taken.

	tissue type - optional
    The tissue type from which the DNA was extracted., Example: liver, whole organism, blood

	country - optional
    Political name of country or ocean in which sequenced sample or isolate was collected, Example: France, China, Pacific Ocean

	geographic area - optional
    Political name of the area of country or ocean in which sequenced sample or isolate was collected, Example: Cambridge, Bordeaux, North Altantic Ridge.

	locality - optional
    More geographic-specific location where sequenced material was sourced. Must have Country AND Geographic area selected., Example: York, Colton, Loch Ness

	latitude/longitude - optional
    Geographical coordinates of the location where the specimen was collected, in decimal degrees (to 2 places); 47.94 N 28.12 W or 45.01 S 4.12 E, Example: 47.94 N 28.12 W or 45.01 S 4.12 E

	collection date - optional
    Date of collection of the original sample/organism, Example: 08-Mar-1975, Mar-1975, 1975

	collector - optional
    Name of the person or institute that originally collected the sample/organism, Example: Dan Janzen

#Repository data

	culture collection - optional
    to annotate live microbial and fungal cultures, and cell lines that have been deposited in or obtained from curated culture collections. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/WebFeat/qualifiers/culture_collection.html, Example: ATCC:26370

	specimen voucher - optional
    Reference to the physical specimen from which the sequence was obtained (e.g. curated museum collection). http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/WebFeat/qualifiers/specimen_voucher.html, Example: AMCC:101706

	biomaterial - optional
    Reference to a living specimen or direct DNA sample from zoos, aquaria, stock centres, seed banks, germplasm repositories and DNA banks. Use where Culture Collection or Specimen Voucher are not appropriate., Example: freetext like AB12345; structured like CGC:CB3912

    name of the reverse direction PCR primer

	reverse primer sequence - optional
    sequences should be given in the IUPAC degenerate-base alphabet, except for the modified bases; those must be enclosed within angle brackets

#Additional PCR primers

	2nd forward primer name - optional
    name of the 2nd forward direction PCR primer

	2nd forward primer sequence - optional
